# Notes on Recruiting

This is a small recollection of ideas, phrases, individual concepts that striked me during this few months helping Coolblue's IT Recruitment in our hiring efforts.

## Hiring is a process that needs to be re-learned every now and then

I though I already was good at this, giving my previous experience in Buenos Aires, but definitely there's always something new to learn and to adapto to, like a complete new kind of developer type and furthermore, people that comes from different countries and societies.

Recruiting requires some adapting to the new "set of rules", and you need to learn the culture of the new company in order to properly hire or suggest people that will be successful here. 

There are things, however, that do not change, like being more able to gaze people's personalities in person instead of through Skype calls, and being able to see through the inherent layer of nervosity that a person being interviewed carries with his/her.

## Sharing is Caring.

Along with "Gewoon, doen" and "Alles voor een glimlach", one of our internal mottos should be "Sharing is caring", as this is the only way we can improve and speed up our processes, and recruiting is just one of them.

During the current interview process, all notes that are taken for candidates that are going to pass to next stages, should be shared and consulted by the people that's going to continue the process. Although our current size allows to share this information informally, it'll come the time that's no longer the case and having the culture of centralizing this information it's going to pay forward.

> **Suggestion**
> 
> At the end of the interviewing process, all parties involved should get together, and discuss the candidate, with all notes taken available. At the moment of voting about hiring or not, if a doubt arises regarding ANYTHING, there should be a note to back that up: a code sample, a bad response to a question, etc.

Information sharing should be a norm not only for bits and pieces about the candidate, but as we grow and more people in the IT department get involved in the hiring process and interviews, having a solid knoledge base about interviewing techniques, or a sound set of questions ready available along as the explanation of what information they attempt to gather, would be extremely valuable.

### Speaking about questions...

In my re-learning process I tried things that didn't get the expected result.
For example, 

* I asked questions that I wasn't really sure the correct answer. I should know beforehand what I consider a really good, a good and a bad answer.
* If it's a tricky question and I need to lead the candidate though it, I prefer testing the question previously with a colleague than in an actual interview.
* When related to non-technical questions, I should actually know what I want to learn from the question I'm asking.
* It's not always my questions the ones that matter. I should provide an environment where the candidate can feel free to ask questions regarding a certain assignment.

## Hire people that's technically sound only, or that show a glimpse of success?
> A developer should be able to be successful within the company, his team, and the customers.

This is something that comes into my mind everytime I'm interviewing someone: Besides having the proper technical skills, is this person going to love what he does here? Is he going to go the extra mile and really enjoy himself inside this environment? Does he/she get stuff done?

## When is a candidate "good enough"?

Asking myself this question, I'm constantly thinking on how will I recognize that person that I want to hire for Coolblue. In general, and given my position, I'll just try to asses the technical skills, but in the face of a developer I need to ask myself:
* _Is this candidate better than I was when I joined Coolblue?_ This is usually a good sign, but a really complicated one to receive. Another way of phrasing this, in my opinion, is: _If I were to join Coolblue right now, what would I think of this guy/gal interviewing me?_
* Another question that I ask myself more often, is _Is this candidate better than the average developer in the IT Department?_. This is usually one bar that the candidates are more often being close to pass, but I still think this is the bare minimum level I should accept.

## How many times we use Fibonacci in our website?

The test should poke on the interviewee capabilities for actual, current technologies and methodologies, in the range from Code Quality to Deployment Systems. Knowing how to find the longest suffix within a string by heart may be misleading, mostly because it does not represent actual experience.

### Can we do this better?

We could gradually change the way we perform interviews, for both people living in The Netherlands as well living in Europe or The World. We could assume the same method for them all.

* Instead of starting with a phone interview, the first point of contact with Coolblue must be code, but not a simple online test regarding some specific questions or functions, we should ask for a small, but complete, online application. This way we are able to know more about the mental process and technical abilities to think an application as whole. This shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 hours to create, but we can give up to 24 hours for a response. This way, when we invite the person for a personal interview with us, he or she hasn't just passed a small objective; we're more than confident that we want to work with this person, at least at the technical level.
* Invite the person to the office, or perform a longer Online interview where he or she must defend this proyect, explain the decisions made or how it could be made even better given the time 
    * __Alternative 1__: Another option could be to do the exact same thing but with another project this person created, but the complexity of showing the code still remains.
    * __Alternative 2__: During the office visit we could actually provide a pre-developed example and ask the candidate to improve it in several ways:
        - Find bugs and remove them.
        - Refactor a part of the project.
        - Get it "production ready".
* We need to ask the candidate how he or she would improve Coolblue. This is a way to demonstrate that it's interested enough in looking the website and the company it's going to work for. Two well founded proposals should be enough.
* During the interview process we could actually present the candidates with current, real-life problems we're facing, and ask for input on those issues. This is also a way to keep the recruiting process relevant and current, and nothing helps better than a fresh view on an actual problem.
* If we could open-source any of our internal proyects, a great starter point to any interview could be a pull request fixing any bug or proposing an improvement to the code.

## Information comes in many forms.

Most of the time, the Cover letter is a waste of time to read. Provides no further information than the CV or whatever we're going to talk about in the first phone interview. It may have provided a benefit in the past, but I think it's no longer the case, then the CV it's the only piece of information we usually have to work with.

But I found that the most interesting information it may be gathered somewhere else also, being the candidate's Github account the best source. I'd rather see all the time the user's Github account better than a cover letter or his/hers LinkedIn profile. Even the lack of a Github account says something about the candidate (Bitbucket, Gitorious, GitLab are all equivalents for Github).

Also important but somehow less, are a twitter feed and a portfolio website. From a Twitter feed we can see if/how participates in a community of previous comments about the candidate's current/past job positions. From a portfolio website we can see the amout of dedication put to something that really reflects the candidate's work.
